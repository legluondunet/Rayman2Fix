# Bootstrap validation

Build `Rayman2Fix.exe` and the inert `Rayman2Fix.dll` on Windows x86.
Run `ctest` on Windows and Linux to exercise synthetic ISO and CUE/BIN data.

Synthetic tests MUST never depend on distribution of Rayman 2 assets.

## Manual checks

- `Rayman2Fix.exe --help` and `--version`.
- `--inspect disc.iso` and `--inspect disc.cue`, each containing one ISO9660
  MODE1 data track. Unsupported formats fail without side effects.
- `--extract disc.cue` writes to `Rayman2Fix/DiscContent`.
- Repeat the extraction: it must refuse to overwrite the prior directory.
- Truncated / malicious image paths fail without writing outside the staging dir.
- Check UTF-16 Windows path support on filenames with French accents.
- When a Joliet supplementary descriptor is present, use its actual long names
  instead of the ISO9660 primary 8.3 aliases; show the source in `--inspect`.
- Export every directory and file component in lowercase, including accented
  characters. Confirm the output is writable and has no Windows read-only bit.
- Extract the CD's single original DLL directory to `dll/`, with no extra
  `DLL`/`Dll` merge. Reject unexpected case-colliding source entries.
- Without Joliet, clearly label the ISO9660 primary-name fallback instead of
  inventing long file names.

**No playable game support, GameFrame render integration, SDL3 initialization
or runtime hooks are asserted by these bootstrap tests.**
